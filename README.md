Abstract

In order to protect the copyright of the digital contents, the robust watermarking techniques are employed based on frequency domains or combined frequency domains. Another techniques, called zero-watermarking which does not modify the original image to embed the watermark but create a watermark from its robust features, is a useful technique for resolving the tension between robustness and invisibility. In this paper, we propose a new zero-watermarking algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform and discrete cosine transform domain with significant feature points matching for improving the robustness. In our proposed method, the original image is firstly separated into three components (Y, Cr, Cb), then its Y-component is performed with discrete wavelet transform, afterwards its LL3 is transformed with discrete cosine transform. To generate the master share of the original image, the DCT-based image is binarized. After performing the Arnold transformation on the watermark, the owner share is generated by taking the XOR operation on the scrambled watermark and master share. The robustness of the our proposed algorithm for imaging processes is analyzed, and the results show that the proposed algorithm is robust to common signal processing such as noise, filtering, JPEG compression, geometric attacks such as rotation, scaling, translation and so on.
